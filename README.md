    "# Introduction:\n",
    "This project analyzes client behavior data from Vanguard's online process, aiming to understand the impact of a redesign. The documentation covers data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EDA & Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Merged multiple datasets.\n",
    "Standardized column names.\n",
    "Cleaned missing values and data inconsistencies.\n",
    "Created visualizations for data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client Behavior Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzed primary client demographics and behavior.\n",
    "Explored client account holdings and balances.\n",
    "Investigated completion rates and errors in the online process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculated completion rates for the control and test groups.\n",
    "Analyzed time spent on each step of the online process.\n",
    "Evaluated error rates, including backward movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Redesign Outcome:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared new design performance against the old one.\n",
    "Reviewed completion rates, time per step, and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducted hypothesis tests on completion rates.\n",
    "Assessed completion rate changes with a cost-effectiveness threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Effectiveness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluated experiment structure, randomization, and biases.\n",
    "Assessed the adequacy of the experiment timeframe.\n",
    "Identified potential additional data needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis provides insights into the impact of the online process redesign on client behavior and completion rates. Further experimentation or data collection may enhance the analysis.\n",
